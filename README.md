# What does this do?
This project contains C/C++ function templates to write cheat codes in a higher level language. The assembly then has to be extracted using a disassembler like `IDA Pro`. It then has to be placed into a cheat code such as the [execute assembly one](http://cosmocortney.ddns.net/enzy/cafe_code_types_en.php#asm) and sent/executed using `JGecko U`. This project does **NOT** aim to compile into a working Wii U home brew app. It is only meant for generating assembly for use with cheat codes.

# How do I compile?
Just like described [here](https://github.com/dimok789/homebrew_launcher/blob/master/README.md#building-the-homebrew-launcher) but without `portlibs`.
